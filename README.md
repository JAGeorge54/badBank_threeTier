# badBank_threeTier
MIT MERN Full Stack Capstone Project

Run: Install node v 14, Download application files into preferred directory, navigate to directoy and enter npm i, then enter npm run start.

Roadmap of future improvements:
There are three things that I wish I could have added to my project. First is the ability 
to update user information, such as changing the user email or user password.
second would be the ability to have multiple accounts for each user such as a savings 
and a checking account. The last thing I wouldâ€™ve liked to add is a way to log in with 
a google account.
